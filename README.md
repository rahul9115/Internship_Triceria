The node part can be neglected since it was just for heroku deployment. You can check out the deployment at https://serene-lake-56024.herokuapp.com/. 
The client or react is stored in project. 
project/src/js/random.js generates the random number.
I made use of local-storage to increment so in the deployment you will see the glitch that it might not start from 100.
Rest the display part is in project/src/components.
